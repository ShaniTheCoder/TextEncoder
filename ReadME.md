# TextEncoder

TextEncoder is a minimal Windows application with a simple python implementation that allows you to encode and decode plain texts that can only be decoded using this TextEncoder code.

## Features

- TextEncoder uses a custom algorithm to transform plain texts into encoded texts that are not readable by humans or machines.
- TextEncoder can also decode the encoded texts back into plain texts, as long as the texts were encoded using this application.
- TextEncoder allows you to copy or paste the input and output texts, as well as save them as text files.
- TextEncoder has a simple and user-friendly interface that lets you choose whether you want to encode or decode texts.
